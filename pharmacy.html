              Immunizations
            </h2>
            <p>
                Immunizations are not just for babies. They have come to play a big role in maintaining health through a lifetime. Several vaccines have become common for adults, especially older adults. To meet this growing need, we have several pharmacists who have advanced training and who have completed the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy immunization certification program. <b>We offer flu, pneumonia and shingles vaccine during normal business hours.</b> We are able to bill medicare for flu and pneumonia vaccines. This year, get your vaccines in a convenient, friendly place…..Smith’s Drugs

              Long-Term Care
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Our same professional care can be found in the nursing homes and assisted living facilities with Smith’s Drugs Long Term Care services.</b> Whether we are serving the whole facility or a single resident, you can be assured that our professional staff are focused and thorough in reviewing medications and identifying problems, especially with these patients who tend to be on multiple drug therapies. In addition, all facility medications are packaged in specialized bubble or blister packs. This ensures safe handling and controlled distribution and, with the color coded system of the packaging, you have one more safety feature to assure correct dosing at the correct time.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Medication Reviews
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to prevent a medication error is to know your pharmacist and know your medication. That’s why we offer extended one-on-one consultations. <b>This focused assessment involves athorough review of all prescription and non-prescription medications and supplements the patient is taking.</b>
                    <br><br>
                During your consultation time, our pharmacist will review when and how to take your medications, identify drugs that are duplications of therapy and assess if you require a medication change due to side effects or interactions with other drugs. Our pharmacist will then contact your doctor to discuss the recommended changes. Some insurances, including Medicare, may cover this service.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Blister Packs
            </h2>
            <p>
                Taking medication correctly is important to getting the optimal helping effect of the drug, but also to prevent dangerous effects from taking it incorrectly. We recognize some of our patients have a higher risk of confusing medications and missing dosing times. That’s why we offer specialized blister packing of medications. This service provides individual, time labeled packages that keep medications organized and provide the assurance that dosages are not being skipped or doubled. Talk to our pharmacy staff about this nominally-priced specialized service.
